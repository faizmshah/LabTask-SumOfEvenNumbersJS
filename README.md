# LabTask-SumOfEvenNumbersJS
Welcome to my project repository for the JavaScript function designed to calculate the sum of all even numbers within an array. This project was part of the MERN Stack Development course offered by SIBAU IT Bootcamp at FAST University. The task was to create a function that efficiently computes the sum of even numbers in an array of integers.

About the Project
Task: Develop a JavaScript function to find the sum of even numbers in an array.
Objective: Create a robust function to process arrays and efficiently calculate the sum of even numbers.
Language Used: JavaScript
Description
This project was an engaging opportunity to dive into JavaScript and tackle the logic behind summing even numbers within an array. The function highlights:

Array Iteration: Efficiently navigating through the array elements to identify even numbers.
Conditional Checking: Implementing logic to determine even numbers.
Accumulating Sum: Calculating and returning the sum of identified even numbers.
Function Highlights
Versatility: The function is designed to handle arrays of any size and accurately compute the sum of even numbers.
Efficiency: Optimized logic for an efficient sum calculation.
